                Glad to see you here! Let me quick define what an IT-Solution Architect is! Such a person must
                come up with possible solutions to solve business problems with IT.
                And such a Person I am. I love to understand different IT-Systems, technologies 
                interfaces, frameworks etc. to prototype different solutions for a problem or usecase. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I'm based in Bocholt, Germany, a small Town near MÃ¼nster.
                I'm working Fulltime for the Company cronos. I'm open to any IT problems 
                that can occur in complex infrastructures.
