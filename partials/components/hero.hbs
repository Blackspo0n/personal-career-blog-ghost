            <p>Glad to see you here! Let me quickly define what an IT solution architect is. Such a person must come up with possible solutions to solve business problems using IT. And that's exactly what I do. I enjoy understanding different IT systems, technologies, interfaces, frameworks, etc. in order to prototype different solutions for a problem or use case.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am based in Bocholt, Germany, a small town near MÃ¼nster, and I work full-time for the company Cronos Automation GmbH. I want to get more into writing and also improve my language skills further.</p>
