# personal-career-blog-ghost
Theme used for my ghost-instance. Works even with noscript!

## Goal
I want to create a own template to host a blog, to send newsletters but also to have an portfolio page.

### Subgoal - Less frameworks
I want to refresh the bare bone html5/css features without using that much frameworks.

To bring technologies together I tend to understand the core concept behind a technology.

It makes completely sense to use frameworks to be able to deploy faster to clients.
But this is not my goal. My goal is to understand and to refresh bare bone knowledge.

## Subgoal - Less Javscript
Javascript is all over the place. I even work with Next.js or Angular on some client projects.

But I am that guy that deactivated javascript per default in my browser.
Im a big fan of the plugin Noscript and I like sites that are at least viewable without javascript.

There also come downsites with my try to use less javascript. 
Some Ghost features like "Sign up" to a newsletter and even the searchbar arenÂ´t functional without javascript. 
But Ii will try to implement solution that work even without it.

But for now my goal is to create at least my expected theme without javascript.

## Leanings
I try to orientate at the themes casper and solo and try to use the shared-theme-assets without the must js part of cz.
