# personal-career-blog-ghost

Theme used for my ghost-instance. Works even with noscript!

## Goal
I want to create a own template to host a blog, to send newsletters but also to have an portfolio page.

### Subgoal - As less as possible javascript
I know Javascript is all over the place. I even work with Next.js or Angular on some client projects.

But I am that guy that deactivated javascript per default in my browser.
Im a big fan of the plugin Noscript and I like sites that are at least viewable without javascript.

There also come downsites with my try to use less javascript.Some Ghost features like Sign up to a newsletter and even the searchbar  arent functional without javascript. But i will try to implement solution that work even without it.

But for now my goal is to create at least my expected theme without javascript.

## Leanings
I try to orientate at the themes casper and solo and try to use the shared-theme-assets

Still work in progress.
